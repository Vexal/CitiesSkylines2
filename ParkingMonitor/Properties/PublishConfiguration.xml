	<LongDescription>
Visualizes vehicles attempts and failures to find parking spots.

<b>Features:</b>
* Display all parking volume or failed parking volume per lot, building, and road
* Group data by district
* Navigate to lot, building, and road with one click
* View total number of cars circling the map looking for parking
* View total number of cars planning to park

<b>How does it work?:</b> This mod monitors the destination of each vehicle. If a vehicle has a parking spot on its
route, and its parking spot changes without the passenger's final destination changing, it counts a failed parking attempt. A vehicle is considered "looking for parking"
if it has at least one failed parking attempt.

<b>Note: This is a beta mod, and the data may be slightly inaccurate in certain edge cases.</b>
