<LongDescription>

<b>New update:</b>
* Added display for the count of cims en-route to a selected building on the building info panel
* Added key bindings menu

<b>Features</b>
Selecting an object applies graphical highlighting to:
* The route of the selected object
* The routes of all objects en-route to the selected building (experimental) -- this feature is performance-intensive and optimizaztion is a work-in-progress
* The routes of all objects passing through a segment (road, ped path, etc) or object (parking lot, transit station, etc -- anything that another object can pass through)
* Destinations and routes of all passengers in a selected vehicle (car, train, bus, plane, boat, tram)
* Employee residence buildings when selecting a building that contains a workplace
* Household members' workplace buildings when selecting a residential building
* In-transit employee commuter vehicles / pedestrians when selecting a workplace
	
Regarding route pathing highlight: This is still experimental. For entities whose route crosses transit types (ex: car -> pedestrian -> subway -> pedestrian), it will highlight the entire route, except for train / subway tracks (it will highlight everything before / after the track, you can see this more easily when zooming out and finding the highlighted stop)

<b>Quick-toggle Controls:</b>
* <b>shift+e</b> to deactivate/reactivate all highlighting
* <b>shift+v</b> to deactivate/reactivate path routing highlighting
* <b>shift+b</b> to deactivate/reactivate building highlighting
* <b>shift+r</b> to deactivate/reactivate road traversal highlighting
* Additional settings can be accessed from the main menu settings for this mod, or the in-game overlay menu from the button at the top right of the screen
* Quick-toggle controls do not change the settings permanently; all other settings persist between games

<b>Future Planned Updates:</b>
* UI Improvements

<b>Other notes:</b>
* Discord username: Vexal / porkchopsnbutter
