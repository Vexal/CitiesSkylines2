<LongDescription>
Formerlly named 'Employee Tracker'

Update: Now supports lane-level route highlighting, and different path graphics for the pedestrian portions of travel (blue lines for walking segments)

<b>Selecting an object applies graphical highlighting to:</b>
* Current chosen pathing route, if applicable (experimental); the highlighted route should update automatically if the chosen path changes
* Destinations of all passengers in a selected vehicle
* Employee residence buildings when selecting a building that contains a workplace
* Household members' workplace buildings when selecting a residential building
* In-transit employee commuter vehicles / pedestrians when selecting a workplace
	
Regarding route pathing highlight: This is still experimental. For entities whose route crosses transit types (ex: car -> pedestrian -> subway -> pedestrian), it will highlight the entire route, except for train / subway tracks (it will highlight everything before / after the track, you can see this more easily when zooming out and finding the highlighted stop)
		
<b>Controls:</b>
* <b>shift+e</b> to deactivate/reactivate all highlighting
* <b>shift+v</b> to deactivate/reactivate path routing highlighting

<b>Future Planned Updates:</b>
* Train/subway track highlighting; UI customization

<b>Other notes:</b>
* Route highlighting is still experimental -- it's yet to be determined if there are unnoticed edge cases. Feel free to report any in the linked forum thread or Discord.
