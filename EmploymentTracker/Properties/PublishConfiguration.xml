<LongDescription>
Formerlly named 'Employee Tracker'

<b>New update:</b>
* Added route-highlighting for all en-route objects to the selected objects (ex: click a building to see who and how is coming to it)
* Support public transit passenger route highlighting (experimental)
* Added in-game options menu to easily toggle highlighting types on/off

<b>Features</b>
Selecting an object applies graphical highlighting to:
* The route of the selected object
* The routes of all objects en-route to the selected building (experimental) -- this feature is performance-intensive and optimizaztion is a work-in-progress
* Destinations and routes of all passengers in a selected vehicle (car, train, bus, plane, boat, tram)
* Employee residence buildings when selecting a building that contains a workplace
* Household members' workplace buildings when selecting a residential building
* In-transit employee commuter vehicles / pedestrians when selecting a workplace
	
Regarding route pathing highlight: This is still experimental. For entities whose route crosses transit types (ex: car -> pedestrian -> subway -> pedestrian), it will highlight the entire route, except for train / subway tracks (it will highlight everything before / after the track, you can see this more easily when zooming out and finding the highlighted stop)
		
<b>Controls:</b>
* <b>shift+e</b> to deactivate/reactivate all highlighting
* <b>shift+v</b> to deactivate/reactivate path routing highlighting

<b>Future Planned Updates:</b>
* Highlight routes of objects traversing through, but not stopping at, a path node
* Performance improvements

<b>Other notes:</b>
* Discord username: Vexal / porkchopsnbutter
