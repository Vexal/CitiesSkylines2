	<LongDescription>
		This mod controls whether vehicles are despawned based on stuck/deadlock detection.
		
		Major update: Vehicle despawn logic is now configurable in this mod, as opposed to a single toggle for all on/off. The configuration allows granularly configuring
		the parameters used by the game to decide if a vehicle's pathing conflict is unrecoverable; the base game is overly aggressive. The recommended settings for this mod are to enable
		despawn for explicit deadlock detection only.
		
		There is also an option to highlight objects that have been detected as stuck/deadlocked to visualize the bottlenecks in the city's traffic, add a delay timer and rate-limiting to removing stuck objects to increase the chance
		the simulation resolves the deadlock itself.
