	<LongDescription>
This mod controls whether vehicles and pedestrians are despawned based on stuck/deadlock detection.
		
*New*: Despawning can now be turned on/off for specific object types in the settings menu. 
		
		
* The configuration allows granularly configuring the parameters used by the game to decide if a vehicle's pathing conflict is unrecoverable; the base game is overly aggressive.
* The recommended settings for this mod are to enable
	despawn for explicit deadlock detection only.
* There is also an option to highlight objects that have been detected as stuck/deadlocked to visualize the bottlenecks in the city's traffic, add a delay timer and rate-limiting to removing stuck objects to increase the chance
	the simulation resolves the deadlock itself.
