	<LongDescription>
Cim Census lets you view the number of current active/inactive cims/vehicles/workers/students/commuters inside/outside your city limits in real-time.

These numbers are based on the actual number of each type of active agent in the simulation, and give a more detailed representation of what the simulation is actually doing than the base game.

The correctness of the agent counting methodology is still being verified; Please report any numbers that don't look correct in the forum.
